h2 On the Oka River midstream
p
    | The landless expanse of the Middle Russian plane is truly impressive in the Oka River midstream. Famous writer
    | Konstantin Paustovskiy wrote: «I suppose, nowhere near Moscow such typically and pathetically Russian places
    | as regards landscape are available». Such commonly Russia-personified land of the Oka River midstream gives the
    | key to awareness about the Russian people being farmers, warriors, constructors, philosophers and explorers.
    | Vehemence goes along with a mystery, and together they penetrate the Russian tales and country songs reflecting the
    | soul of the nation, in which «the flows of tenderness are replaced by the rapids of ferocious melancholy» as was
    | remarked by geographer and poet Vladimir Solntsev. The Oka River lands are totally preoccupied and filled with
    | the Russian history.

    | Mount, Troitsky (Trinity) cathedral in the kremlin, Troitsky and Iliinsky churches «on the trading place»,

    | the Nara River, at the confluence with the Oka River there is Vladychny (Hierarchal) nunnery dated back to 1360.
    | In time of frequent tartars’ raids in the XV to XVII century the nunnery was fenced off by the walls and looked
    | as a fortress. In 1806, it was converted to a nunnery. On the opposite bank there is Vysotsky (High) monastery
    | erected in 1374 by Vladimir Donskoy, the brother of Dmitriy Donskoy, on a high hill (so the name is derived from
    | the height), taken out by request of Sergey Radonezhskiy. His follower Afanasiy was appointed as the head of a
    | monastery, and after he had moved to the TsarGrad, Afanasiy II was elected to serve as a superior. Amongst the
    | church sanctuaries there are relics of about 200 God’s saints including those of Sergey Radonezhskiy. In 1571 the
    | monastery was  devastated by the Crimean-Tatar forces led by Khan Devlet-Girey. The fence and 4 towers were built
    | in 1647. In clear weather, when looking from the monastery walls you are impressed by the vastness of the
    | Oka River valley. On the opposite side the Serpukhov town also unfolds majestic panorama reaching the Oka River.
